**Repository for fourth year project "Reducing Campus Emissions Using Machine Learning"**
LA14YW.csv is the weather data used in many of the code files.
Short term electricity consumption forecasting (function).ipynb is the code used to create and call the function that forecasts the short term electricty consumption of a chosen building for a specified time period.
covid forecasting.ipynb is the code used to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on campus electricty consumption.
lec_main_df.csv is the consumption readings of the lec main electricty meter used to train the short term electricity consumption model.
main_meters_avg.csv is the average reading at each timestamp of 14 main electricty meters on campus. 
onlinesolar.csv is the data from an online source used to confirm the irradiance values from the weather station are correct.
short term electricity consumption forecasting (training).ipynb is the code used to train the short term electricty consumption model used in the function, multiple models are trained and optimised then the chosen models are saved for use in the function.
solar (2).ipynb is the code used to determine the energy generation of a proposed solar power system.
turbine_data (1).csv is the power generation and wind speed data from the wind turbine.
wind (1).ipynb is the code used to determine the descriptive statistics relating to the wind turbine.
wind_times.csv is the average wind speed and wind turbine power generation averaged at each minute of the day.
wt_ext files are the files with the data from the turbine.
